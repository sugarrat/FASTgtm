Re-uses flow sheet for multiple clients
Needs flexible, multi-commodity capability
ROI-focused, 2-3 year payback requirement
Pain points: Equipment downtime = revenue loss, inflexible equipment
Decision criteria: Price (35%), reliability/uptime (30%), versatility (20%), support response time (15%)
Persona 3 BOOM Operator
Mid-tier miner
Evaluated on cost per ton, uptime
Limited capital budget, needs board approval for &gt; $100k
Pain points: budget, pressure to reduce opex, limited engineering staff
Decision criteria: Price (40%), lead time (25%), proven reliability (20%), support (15%)
Persona 1 Cost-Constrained Operations Manager
Adding capacity to existing plant
Tight timeline and fixed budget
Doesn't want to over-engineer
Pain points: Equipment lead times delaying commissioning, budget overruns
Decision criteria: Delivery time (35%), price (30%), compatibility with existing equipment (20%), technical risk (15%)
Persona 2 Brownfield Expansion Project Manager
Process Engineer (Technical gate): Performance specifications, operating parameters
Operations Manager (User gate): Reliability, maintenance requirements, support
Procurement Manager (Commercial gate): Price, terms, delivery, risk management
Plant Manager (Budget holder): Total cost of ownership, business case
CFO/Board (Final approval &gt;$X): Financial return, strategic fit
Buying Process Decision Influencers &amp; Their Priorities
Awareness (Problem recognition) - 0-2 months Equipment failure, capacity expansion need, new project Consideration (Vendor shortlist) - 1-3 months RFQ process, 2-3 vendors typically Evaluation (Technical &amp; commercial) - 2-4 months Technical specification review, site visits, reference checks Decision (Approvals &amp; contracting) - 1-3 months Multiple approval levels depending on value Implementation (Delivery &amp; commissioning) - 3-6 months
Buying Process Typical Journey
Sales Team: Average sales cycle length by deal size and region
Sales Team: Approval thresholds by customer type
Sales Team: Typical RFQ requirements and evaluation criteria
Finance: Payment terms and financing options currently offered
Buying Process Inputs Needed
Strategy: Generally NOT the target for FAST spirals initially
Exception: Brownfield, non-critical applications where they specify "budget option acceptable"
Risk: Brand dilution if they associate your company with "cheap equipment" PRIMARY TARGET
Multiple sites, professional procurement, cost-conscious
Want brand reliability but don't need cutting-edge performance PRIMARY TARGET
Price-sensitive, limited technical resources
Need support but can't afford premium pricing SECONDARY TARGET (Phase 2)
Highly price-sensitive, often purchasing through distributors
May need financing or rental options
Customer Tiers
Sales: Customer interviews (10-15) to validate personas Sales: CRM data analysis - buyer titles, company sizes, deal characteristics Sales: Survey of lost opportunities - why didn't they buy? Sales: Common support requests by customer type
Inputs Needed (Personas)
Mineral Sands: mitigate the risk of losing market share to low cost suppliers with this new product line. Iron ore: North America, Western Australia Chromite: Emerging market segment with less brand loyalty
Industrial minerals: silica sand, garnet Iron ore, because there is not an urgent need to protect market share Challenge this approach - Brazilians setting up shop in Quebec to refurbish spirals. Chromite, because the market is small
Coal, because this market is not growing and the spirals are large diameter.
Target Industries &amp; Applications
Sales Historical data on lost opportunities due to price (last 3 years)
Sales Estimate of deals lost to low-cost Asian manufacturers
Sales Total addressable market for spirals by commodity (units/year, AUD), focus on [Target Commodity] Sales Current average spiral sale price by commodity segment Size the "budget buyer" segment (estimate 30-40% of total market)
Growth projections for [Target Commodity]
Market Size &amp; Growth
Africa
India
Southeast Asia
South America Australia North America Challenge - does this need region need to be in phase 1 to combat spiral refurbishment in Canada? Europe Sales: Price sensitivity analysis by geography
Sales: Local competitor presence and pricing
Operations: Import duties, local content requirements by country Operations: Logistics costs and lead times to each region
Geographic Priorities
Low-cost Asian manufacturers (Chinese, Vietnamese suppliers)
Second-hand/refurbished spirals mtSpirals (internal cannibalization risk)
Alternative separation methods (tables, jigs, centrifugal concentrators) Sales: Competitor pricing database (models, capacities, prices)
Sales: Win/loss analysis - why customers choose competitors
Engineering: Technical performance comparison (recovery, grade, capacity)
Engineering: Feature comparison matrix Sales: Competitor after-sales service reputation Established brand reputation (risk mitigation for buyers)
Global service network
Technical support and process optimization expertise
Faster delivery than Asian imports (potentially)
Quality consistency vs. local fabricators
